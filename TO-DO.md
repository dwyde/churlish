# Very soon
- Save full PGN (not current board PGN)
- README
- Enter PGN headers before save
- paste PGN on the right?

# Soonish
- What happens if you paste in multiple PGN games?
- remove PGN headers if a piece gets moved? maybe?
- Display the current move number
- Jump to a move
- autoplay
- Better encoding?

# At some point
- Mobile style
- File API: upload a game?
- .gitignore
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Unit tests?
- Code cleanup: one global, game.PAWN, etc.

# Probably never
- Multiple PGN games => database
- Allow branches in the game
- PGN comments?
